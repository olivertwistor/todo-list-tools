# Privacy policy
When using Todo List Tools you are connecting to a [Remember the Milk][1] 
account. Thereby you are exposing data within that account.

## What data this application is collecting
In order for this application to authenticate itself to the [Remember the Milk 
API][2], it directs the user to the Remember The Milk website to login and 
give it the necessary permissions. This application does not collect these 
credentials; they are only used by Remember The Milk to generate an 
authentication token for this application to use.

Once authenticated to Remember the Milk, this app retrieves information about  
every list and smartlist found in the account, the lists themselves the user 
selects and the tasks within those lists.

## How this application use the data
This application uses the collected data mentioned earlier in this document to 
present aggregations and calculations on that data to the user.

## What data this application stores
The only piece of data stored is the authentication token. That token is 
stored in a configuration file on the user's device. When the user closes the 
application, all other data such as lists and tasks are gone, since it only 
resides in memory.
