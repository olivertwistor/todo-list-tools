When using Todo List Tools you are connecting to a [Remember the Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com) account. Thereby you are exposing data within that account.

## What data this application is collecting

This application does not collect these credentials; they are only used by Remember The Milk to generate an authentication token for this application to use.

Once authenticated to Remember the Milk, this app retrieves information about every list and smartlist found in the account, the lists themselves the user selects and the tasks within those lists.

## How this application use the data

This application uses the collected data mentioned in this document to present aggregations and calculations on that data to the user.

## What data this application stores

The only piece of data stored is the authentication token. That token is stored in a configuration file on the user's device. When the user closes the application, all other data such as lists and tasks are gone, since it only resides in memory.
